to reference the player prefs for each level:

// declare variables to reference playerprefs from all 3 levels
int bossdmg1;
int teamdmg1;
...
(repeat to have var for both numbers, for all 3 lvls)

//in Start() initialize variables to hold playerprefs
// for lvl 1
bossdmg1 = PlayerPrefs.GetInt("BossDmg1");
teamdmg1 = PlayerPrefs.GetInt("TeamDmg1");

// for lvl 2
bossdmg2 = PlayerPrefs.GetInt("BossDmg2");
teamdmg2 = PlayerPrefs.GetInt("TeamDmg2");

// for lvl 3
bossdmg3 = PlayerPrefs.GetInt("BossDmg3");
teamdmg3 = PlayerPrefs.GetInt("TeamDmg3");

* this will return the int value associated with the key "BossDmg1" (for example) which is set in the csvFilePrinters.

for comparing and saving high score:

// declare temp variables to reference current high score playerprefs for each level 
private int highScoreT1;
private int highScoreB1;

private int highScoreT2;
private int highScoreB1;

private int highScoreT3;
private int highScoreB1;

* intialize to 0 in start()

// in FixedUpdate() or (optional) self made function such as updateScores() to be called in FixedUpdate()

if (bossdmg1 > highScoreB1) // if > 0 on first time step. compares to HighScore playerpref being held by temp var after first timestep
{
    PlayerPrefs.SetInt("HighScoreB1", bossdmg1); // save new highscore 
    highScoreB1 = PlayerPrefs.GetInt("HighScoreB1"); // this will update the temp variable to compare to incoming scores
    Playerprefs.Save(); // saves the playerprefs if changed
}

* repeat for all highscores

to reference the highscores in the textfields:
pull the value from the temp varaibles holding the highscore playerprefs, not from playerprefs.GetInt()
